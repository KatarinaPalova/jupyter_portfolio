    "# ðŸ“ˆ  Answering business questions about record store using SQL \n",
    "In this project we will look at the example database in SQLite called Chinook which contains data about a record store. We will be trying to answer some questions that the business might have when making decisions about marketing or pricing strategies. This project is part of the Dataquest's data engineering course guided projects. The Chinook database is available here: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give guidance in the following areas:\n",
    "- How to decide on new artists based on their music genre?\n",
    "- Which employees perform their best and are there any predictors of their success?\n",
    "- What should be the startegy in different markets based on countries?\n",
    "- Is buying whole albums advantegous for the company? How can the pricing startegy be adapted based on this information?"
