    "# 🚀 Mobile Apps Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile Apps are on the rise, the two major platforms that offer these apps are Google Play and Apple App Store. In Q3 2022 there were more than 3.5 milion apps on Google's platform and more than 1.6 million apps on Apple's platform [(Statista)](https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/launch-app-on-android-or-ios-app-store-first/). The competition is high and consequently software development companies need to understand what kind of an app has the highest chance to succeed. That is the main purpose of this exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis dives into a dataset on mobile apps of two major app marketplaces. We will investigate their user data to try to underpin what would be the best app genre to concentrate on if we want to maximse our chances of having a succesful and profitable app. The company is looking to launch an app with the following attributes:\n",
    "1. Free App\n",
    "2. English language only\n",
    "3. Monetisation through in-app purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "Having these three conditions we will try to narrow down the areas to explore by providing a recommendation on the 3 app genres that present the biggest opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company plans to first rollout on Google Play to prove the concept amd take advantage of a larger userbase. Once the concept is proven they are planning to expand to Apple App Store. That's why data from the Google dataset will have a bigger weight when we'll make our recommendations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's goal is also to demonstrate an example of how we can use Python to analyze data to gain business insights and **help stakeholders make informed decisions**."

Therefore the company would have to convince the users that their app can compete with what they are using currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2nd Approach\n",
    "On the other hand, if we look into apps that are popular (have fairly high number of installs/reviews) but have the lower average ratings we might have a better chance of coming up with an app that will have the audience and will be willing to try something new as they aren't too satisfied with the current app."

    "## Final Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend the 2nd approach, so that's the one I'm going to develop below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing data from Google and Apple in terms of market saturation, the hardest markets to penetrate will be in gaming, education and utility/tools apps. These categories have the highest share of apps on these markets and therefore it will be hard to stand out in the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need people to actually download our app and install it on their device so that we can convince to make an in-app purchase. Ideally we want to find a category that people install often but the competition (number of apps) isn't that big. And the average rating of the apps is towards the lower end so that we have a better chance of bringing improvement. Last thing we might want to consider are categories that have well-established apps with loyal users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I would consider the following genres, Social, Communication, Video and Photography apps. These categories have usually a couple of well established apps (Facebook, Instagram...) and people don't go for new apps on the market that often. A similar case might be in the Music category.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to create an objective way to choose the category we could give a weight to the different parameters and then score each category and take the one with the highest score. As we are first launching on Google Play Store we will start with that one and then simply verify if the recommendation makes sense for Apple App Store as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the weight we're going to attribute to the different factors:\n",
    "1. Share of apps 30% (Category with the smallest number of apps gets the most points)\n",
    "2. Number of Installs 60% (Category with the highest average number of installs gets the most points)\n",
    "3. Average rating 10% (Category with the lowest average ranking gets the most points)\n",
    "\n",
    "final_score = 30% * Number of Apps rank + 60% * Average number of installs + 10% * Average rating\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't look at the number of reviews as those closely correlate with the number of installs. The number of installs gets the highest weight as it is the factor that will help us the most in establishing a big enough audience to market to. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to say is that the spread of rating (difference between highest and lowest rating) isn't very big, therefore this will not have that big of an impact and we will give it a lower weight equally."
